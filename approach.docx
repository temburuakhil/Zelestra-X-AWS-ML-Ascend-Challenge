Solar Panel Efficiency Prediction - Project Documentation

1. Project Overview
------------------
This project aims to predict solar panel efficiency based on various environmental and technical parameters. The solution implements a sophisticated machine learning pipeline that includes advanced feature engineering, model optimization, and ensemble learning techniques.

2. Tools and Technologies
------------------------
- Python 3.x
- Key Libraries:
  * pandas & numpy: Data manipulation and numerical computations
  * scikit-learn: Machine learning algorithms and utilities
  * XGBoost: Gradient boosting framework
  * LightGBM: Light Gradient Boosting Machine
  * Optuna: Hyperparameter optimization
  * SHAP: Model interpretation and feature importance analysis
  * matplotlib & seaborn: Data visualization

3. Feature Engineering
---------------------
The feature engineering process is implemented in src/feature_engineering.py and includes:

a) Data Cleaning:
   - Handling missing values using median for numeric features and mode for categorical features
   - Converting string numeric columns to proper numeric types
   - Handling outliers using IQR and Z-score methods

b) Advanced Feature Creation:
   - Power-related features:
     * power_output = voltage * current
     * power_per_area = power_output / irradiance
   
   - Temperature efficiency relationships:
     * temp_efficiency_ratio = module_temperature / (temperature + 273.15)
     * temp_difference = module_temperature - temperature
   
   - Environmental impact features:
     * irradiance_temp_interaction = irradiance * module_temperature
     * humidity_temp_interaction = humidity * temperature
     * cloud_irradiance_ratio = cloud_coverage / irradiance
   
   - Degradation indicators:
     * age_maintenance_ratio = panel_age / maintenance_count
     * soiling_age_interaction = soiling_ratio * panel_age
   
   - Cooling effect:
     * wind_cooling_effect = wind_speed / module_temperature
   
   - Efficiency indicators:
     * theoretical_efficiency = irradiance * (1 - soiling_ratio) * (1 - cloud_coverage/100)
   
   - Polynomial features:
     * temp_squared = temperature^2
     * irradiance_squared = irradiance^2
     * humidity_squared = humidity^2
